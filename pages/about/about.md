## Who is the FLkit for?

The Federated Learning Kit (FLkit) is designed to help life scientists harness the power of federated learning in their
projects. It provides guidance on techniques and tools for working with decentralized, sensitive data,
enabling privacy-preserving collaboration and deeper insights without sharing raw data.

How we want to sustain and govern FLkit is yet to be determined. At the moment we are looking for contributors to help,
but our goals are to open up the FLkit to the community and make it a community-driven project.
