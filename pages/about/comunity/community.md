Initially established as a component of the ELIXIR-CONVERGE project, the RDMkit
community has experienced continuous growth, an esteemed editorial board, committed contributors, and a growing user
base.
The community convenes under the RDMkit Club, a platform for collective engagement where members share experiences,
address queries, troubleshoot issues, and stay updated on pertinent developments. Additionally, we maintain close
collaboration with the [ELIXIR FL Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/research-data-management).
