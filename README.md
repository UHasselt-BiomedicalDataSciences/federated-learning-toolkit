**This is a work in progress.**

# How to:

At the moment this is a private repo. This means we can not use github actions / pages. We will either make it public or pay for an enterprise account. 

Here is the documentation on [Elixir Tookit Theme](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/getting_started) and how to use it.

To develop locally you can install Ruby and Jekyl locally as explained here(https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/elixir-toolkit-theme?tab=readme-ov-file#locally-using-jekyll).
For running the server there is a `run.sh` shortcut with some handy flags.

Alternativelly as explained here([https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/elixir-toolkit-theme?tab=readme-ov-file#locally-using-jekyll](https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/elixir-toolkit-theme?tab=readme-ov-file#locally-using-docker)) there is a docker image, but it never worked for me.

### Making changes

Any change to the master/main branch will automatically trigger the re-deployment of the website, so your changes come live. More information on how you can configure the theme can be found using these links:
